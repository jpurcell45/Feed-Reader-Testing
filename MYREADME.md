*Feed Reader Test Project

###Overview

This is a suite of tests written to test the functionality
of the feed reader application.

###Sources

This application uses an application called Jasmine to run
the tests.

###Application Structure

The application uses a Jasmine spec file called feedreader.js to
define the spec and than write a function to test the application
and see if it passes the spec.

###Operation

In order to run the application simply open the index.html file in
your favorite browser. Jasmine will display the suites of tests and
the test result at the bottom of the browser window.
